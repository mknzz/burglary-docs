# Troubleshooting sk-burglary 3.3.7

Please make sure you have followed [Installing](https://mknzz.github.io/burglary-docs/install.html) and [Main Config](https://mknzz.github.io/burglary-docs/config.html).

## The break in minigame is not working

If you're attempting to break into a door and nothing happens, follow these steps:

> - **Check the client console**: An error message should appear, indicating the missing minigame. However, in some cases, no error may be printed.
>
> - **Check the minigame option**: Ensure that the minigame variable in `Config.T3_BreakInMinigame` (for the tier where the issue occurred) is set to a valid option. The valid options are: 
>   - "circle"
>   - "square"
>   - "lockpick"
>
> - **Check the required minigame resources**: 
>   - For the "lockpick" or "circle" minigames, ensure the necessary resources are enabled in your `config.lua`:
>     - `qb-lockpick` or `qb-minigames` (for "lockpick")
>     - `ps-ui` or `ox_lib` (for "circle")
>

For more break in minigame information, please visit the [Houses Config](https://mknzz.github.io/burglary-docs/tier_config.html) section of our docs.
