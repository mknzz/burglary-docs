# Installing sk-burglary 3.1

{: .note }
Please note that you won't be able to utilize your configurations from qb-burglary 2.0. The content within the configuration files has been revamped for better readability and organization. Although there are some similarities within the configs, manual replacement will be necessary.

### Please read the installation guide below carefully.

Before following these steps make sure qb-burglary 2.0 has been removed from your resource folder.

> 1. Extract the 3.1 resource and copy it into either the [qb] or [standalone] folder. This step is optional; you can place the resource anywhere, as long as it's started after the required resources.
>
> 2. Configuration might be required in the config.lua file. Check the Config.DefaultResources table and ensure that the resource names match those on your server.
>
> 3. Add the items from items.md to your item list.
>
> 4. Add the item images from the [img] sub folder to your inventory images folder.
