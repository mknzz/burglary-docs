# Installing sk-burglary 3.1

{: .note }
Please note that you won't be able to utilize your configurations from qb-burglary 2.0. The content within the configuration files has been revamped for better readability and organization. Although there are some similarities within the configs, manual replacement will be necessary.

## You need the following required resources.

> - **qb-core**
> 
> - **qb-target**
>
> - **qb-menu**
>
> - **qb-skillbar**
>
> - **qb-lockpick**

## Please read the installation guide below carefully.

{: .important }
It is **strongly recommended** to use the latest recommended FiveM server artifact version, which is currently **7290**. However, this resource should be compatible with server versions starting from **3245** and onwards. For the game build, it is advised to use any version ranging from **2189** to **2802**. Please note that **OneSync** must be enabled.

**Before following these steps make sure qb-burglary 2.0 has been removed from your resource folder.**

> 1. Extract the 3.1 resource and copy it into either the `qb` or `standalone` folder. This step is optional; you can place the resource anywhere, as long as it's started after the required resources.
>
> 2. Configuration might be required in the `config.lua` file. Check the `Config.DefaultResources` table and ensure that the resource names match those on your server.
>
> 3. Add the items from `items.md` to your item list.
>
> 4. Add the item images from the `img` subfolder to your inventory images folder.
>
> 5. For a more detailed guide on configuration, please visit the [Main Config](https://mknzz.github.io/burglary-docs/config.html#configuring-sk-burglary-31) section of our docs.
